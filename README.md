# Lake Temperature Analysis: Insights from NOAA Data (C Programming)

## Purpose
This project aims to perform a variety of calculations and draw conclusions based on data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The datasets include daily average surface temperatures for six lakes: Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Superior, and Lake St. Clair in 2019 and 2018. The calculations involve determining yearly averages, identifying the warmest and coldest lakes, and classifying lakes above or below the combined average. The analysis covers the warmest and coldest days for each lake, summer and winter average temperatures, swim-friendly days, and frozen days. Part 1 of the project is repeated with the 2018 dataset, and the intended audience includes companies conducting studies on the great six lakes.

## Experience
Completing this project in the C programming language proved to be an enriching educational journey. It not only deepened our understanding of the course material but also provided valuable insights into collaborative group projects. Integrating C programming and geography was particularly enjoyable as it demonstrated real-life applications of programming skills. Working with two-dimensional arrays posed a challenge, and harmonizing the report's style with contributions from four individuals was another notable hurdle.

## Improvements and Lessons
In hindsight, using helping functions in C could enhance code efficiency and reduce redundancy. Additionally, discussing document format and style beforehand would streamline the process of achieving consistency throughout the report. These lessons learned will undoubtedly enhance future project experiences.
